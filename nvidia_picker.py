"""Pick an NVIDIA hosted model that actually works for a visitor's own API key.

Why this exists: NVIDIA's public catalog lists many models a given key cannot call (HTTP 404
"Function ... not found for account"), the set differs from key to key, models get retired (410),
and the free servers are sometimes overloaded (503 / timeouts). So a hardcoded default, or even a
live catalog list, is not enough: the only reliable test is a real request with the visitor's key.

find_working_model() probes candidates in parallel (so a few slow models cannot eat the time
budget), prefers the fastest model that returns a useful answer, and when nothing works it says
why (rejected key / no model access / servers busy) instead of just "no model worked".
Nothing here depends on Streamlit.
